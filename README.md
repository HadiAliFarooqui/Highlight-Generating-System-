# Highlight-Generating-System-
This project has 3 main features: 1. Automatic Video highlights generator, 2. Document summarization, and 3. Multiple document comparison. 

## Overview of each feature: 
### 1. Video Summarization:
Imagine you don't have access to the highlights of the recent IPL cricket match and you don't have enough time to watch the full match, nor you have a habit of reading 
the scores from the newspaper (which is kinda boring). Or imagine you are creating your own Premium League and you don't have enough expertize of generating highlights of the full length recorded match. That's where our feature comes in, it's a simple U.I (user interface) application wherein all you need to do is, simply upload your full length match video and within few minutes, your highlights will be generated (i.e. 1-2 hrs length of video will be converted to short clip of around 10 - 15 minutes).
